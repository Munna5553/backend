## Introduction

Our YouTube-like platform backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage users, videos, and related interactions on our platform. By leveraging this backend, developers can focus on building engaging user interfaces without worrying about the complexities of backend operations.

## Features

- **User Management:** Create, update, and delete user accounts.
- **Video Upload:** Allow users to upload videos to the platform.
- **Video Management:** Handle video metadata, views, likes, and comments.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement search functionality to find videos based on keywords.
- **User Interaction:** Enable users to like, comment, and share videos.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize user input to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-like-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd youtube-like-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and provide the following configurations:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/youtube-like-platform
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

   - `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
   - `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
